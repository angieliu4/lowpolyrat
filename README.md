##### *GAME CONTENT*

A low-poly, 3D game featuring a rat (the player), puzzles, environmental hazards, and a single objective: get the cheese. Pay attention to the scent marking to locate it! Players must avoid both a cat and a human carefully guarding that yellow triangle. The rat must get past locked doors, water spills, and mouse traps. There are mouse holes around the house to aid players.
